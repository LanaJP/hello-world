Hello!

Recently, I passed the final qualifying exam at SPbPU on C++ development. I have a profile in [NotABug](https://notabug.org/Owl_L) where I register my student projects and I intend to transfer data to GitHub.

While I was a student, **I mastered the following themes**: C/C++ programming procedures, OOP (structures, classes, templates, basic STL containers), RTTI, new standards C++ 14/11/17 (MS Visual Studio).  Databases foundation such as SQL queries, relationship normalization, database design.
I have knowledge of software development methodology & Qt components, Model-View-Controller (MVC) application architecture principles.

I intend to continue my studies with an extensive study of C++ and Qt.
